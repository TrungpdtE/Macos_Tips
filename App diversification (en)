# HOW TO RUN WINDOWS GAMES ON macOS

I. Light Applications (No High System Requirements for RAM, etc.)
For simple applications that don’t require high performance (uses only about 50% of your Mac’s RAM on Windows, or up to 70-80% with overclocking), you can use:

Install Windows through Parallels – easy and efficient.
Install Windows via VMware – another straightforward option.
II. High-Performance Applications (Demanding System Requirements)
For applications needing high performance, full software support, and maximum RAM utilization:

Use CrossOver: This can create multiple virtual machines and provides decent performance but does not support DirectX 11 or 12. Some game engines may have font and audio errors.
III. Use Apple’s Game Porting Toolkit
Run via Terminal: This offers stable performance with support for DirectX 11 and DirectX 12, making it ideal for many games.
IV. Most Stable Solution – Combine Both Methods
Use Crossover and Apple’s Game Porting Toolkit Together: With Crossover (CXP), you can configure it to enable DirectX 11 and 12 support, combining the strengths of both solutions.

# HOW TO RUN iOS GAMES ON macOS
Use PlayCover to run IPA files.
On Macs with Apple Silicon, some iOS apps can be downloaded directly from the App Store.
Use software like iMazing to port iOS apps directly to macOS.

#HOW TO RUN ANDROID GAMES ON macOS

For Intel Macs: Run emulation software like Nox (note: currently unsupported on M1).
Temporary Solution for M1 Macs: Use Android Studio to create a virtual Android device, though it’s slow and lacks performance.
Another option is to install an Android virtual machine on VMware.
